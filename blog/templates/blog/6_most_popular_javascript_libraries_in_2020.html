                <img src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/chart.jpg' %}" alt="">
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  Chart.js is very interesting if you think about any data
                  visualization tool or library in javascript people are going
                  to point you to chart.js. chart.js is awesome because it shows
                  you data in different ways. Chart.js was created by
                  london-based developer nick downey and it was in 2003. so
                  already it's about seven years old what i like a lot about
                  this is that the fact that you know me seeing that a library
                  has been out for a couple of years just shows me how stable
                  that platform is you know a lot of people try to create new
                  tools just so that they can get their name out so that they
                  can you know maybe fix a specific problem but the thing about
                  it is that you actually want it to last a while you want it
                  for people to use it to develop it into something else for it
                  to grow and so chart.js is something like that it is great for
                  data visualization like i told you guys and the cool thing
                  about it is that it uses animation effects out of the box.

                <h2 class="title is-4">5. jQuery</h2>
                <img src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/jquery.jpeg' %}" alt="">
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  jQuery is interesting because it was actually the first
                  library that i used in javascript because it's funny man i
                  started off with javascript and it was um kind of hard for me
                  to to to pick it up just because i was like oh man html is
                  pretty easy and css is kind of easy too but then i started
                  using javascript i thought it was a little bit complicated but
                  you know comparing it to something like java i know the
                  javascript is way easier to implement to learn to pick up and
                  all of this i also think that it's a little bit more
                  human-like and not so machine-like but the thing about this is
                  that i was having a hard time you know looking for a an easy
                  library to implement into my code so i stumbled upon jQuery
                  because i heard that it's actually one of the most famous ones
                  and it's interesting because it's actually kind of old it's to
                  it was released in 2006 by John Resig. this is john right here
                  thank you john you know right now at least 50 and a lot of
                  studies they show this that at least 50 of all known websites
                  use some type of So the cool thing about this is that it can
                  actually select dom elements and even create animations and
                  handle events but it's getting little bit outdated when you
                  want to connect it with the more modern technologies it might
                  have a little bit of problem.

                <h2 class="title is-4">4. Anime.js</h2>
                <img src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/anime.png' %}" alt="">
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  The internet is becoming so advanced that you can even do
                  animations using javascript. Anime.js is great for that it's
                  more for 2d designs and but you can also do 3d designs on it.
                  Anime.js one of the most popular js animation libraries out
                  there without a freaking doubt and the cool thing about it is
                  that it's supported by most major browsers so you don't have
                  to worry about you know you writing that code for it and not
                  being supported by anything and it's cool because you can
                  actually just you know add animations really fast you don't
                  have to be an expert to start writing this you can just if you
                  know a little bit of code and you know how things interact
                  with each other then you can end up with really cool
                  animations.

                <h2 class="title is-4">3. Vue.js</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/veu.png' %}" alt="">
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  Vue.js is funny because it's it's very similar to angular and
                  react in the same way that it's a SPA you know it's a Single
                  Page Application library and the cool thing about it as well
                  is that you know the name itself says veu is view but it's
                  kind of like a wordplay to show that it's you know it's
                  related to everything that you view on the website so it was
                  developed by Evan You while he was in google and it's cool
                  because you can easily mix it and match it with other other
                  different projects so if you're using angular or you're using
                  react and you want to mix it up with. If you're using angular
                  and you want to mix it up with react it's going to be hard for
                  you if you're react and you want to mix it with vue it's going
                  to be very easy same with angular. So vue makes it very easy
                  for you to mix it in your actual projects right now so it's
                  it's easy for you to use it as a front end and then connect it
                  to a back-end technology such as nodejs or anything related to
                  that the cool thing about it is that it uses a virtual dom
                  just like react does so it doesn't have to wait for the whole
                  page to load it actually just updates things on the fly this
                  is this really literally changed the internet. So vue is easy
                  to learn.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2 class="title is-4">2. React.js</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/react.png' %}" alt="">
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  So React right now has a big market share for web development
                  specifically because it's very very big you know there's a lot
                  of demand for it there is so much community behind it . And
                  the react is create by facebook. And the guy who created react
                  was Jordan Walke and he made it while he was still working in
                  facebook. Javascript is actually used for ui interfaces and ui
                  interfaces pretty much means end development you know the way
                  that the user interacts with the actual application so react
                  made it very very simple. One of the cool thing about it is
                  that regularly react is sometimes called a SPA (Single Page
                  Application). so like i said it's used for interfaces and the
                  cool thing about it that is that it can dynamically load
                  content without having to refresh the whole page so that is
                  completely awesome in my opinion. One of the biggest things
                  that i loved about facebook is that you can actually like
                  pages and you can see it update on the fly without having to
                  wait for the whole page to refresh sometimes that's super slow
                  so that literally just changed everything it's like when
                  you're on facebook you're just in one simple window pretty
                  much and that's what it means pretty much you know to be in a
                  single page application you can do several different functions
                  on it it's going to be a little bit more limited than
                  multi-page applications because obviously you have to load
                  everything in the same page. Right now use react is used by
                  huge companies like: Microsoft, Walmart, Tesla, Dropbox,
                  Paypal, Airbnb, Netflix, Reddit, New York's time and even
                  apple uses it.

                <h2 class="title is-4">1. Angular</h2>
                <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/angular.png' %}" alt="">
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  As you guys know Angular is one of the most popular libraries
                  in javascript. A lot of different experts consider it a
                  framework as well but it's also a library so one of the things
                  about angular is that it is actually developed by google
                  google so it's funny you know all all of these big companies
                  like facebook google and a bunch of them actually develop
                  their own libraries and frameworks just because they have to
                  go through different you know problems that they themselves
                  have to solve and what happens well they put out they actually
                  put up tools for the whole market to use and they're very
                  beneficial and angular is one of them that google made so
                  angular is interesting because it was actually released in
                  2010 so angular is 10 years old so you can talk about it being
                  a stable. One of the cool things about it is that it was
                  completely revamped in 2016 and the thing about it is that
                  they changed completely their philosophy on it and after the
                  version 2 they actually started to use typescript. angular is
                  actually became a framework when it turned into version 2. and
                  right now version 2 is is what is being used.
