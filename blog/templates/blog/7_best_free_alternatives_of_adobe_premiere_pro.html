                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  lightworks is a super lightweight editing program it starts
                  fast playback and editing, in general, goes super smooth and
                  that is because of its slim feature set, it is mostly used for
                  simple editing and very basic effects so even though that you
                  get a professional toolset for editing it doesn't come with
                  many features that could be either a drawback or a positive
                  note for the type of work that you do know one thing it does
                  have are some very nice color correction and grading tools.
                  Lightworks is completely free however you are limited to a
                  certain file format and you cannot export higher than a 720p
                  resolution if that is a the problem for you then there is, of
                  course, the pro version which doesn't have more features other
                  than the export options and the supported file formats.
                </p>

                <h2 class="title is-4">2. Shotcut</h2>
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  Shotcut is completely free there's no pro version or anything
                  like that, and I find it very similar to light works however
                  making animations using keyframes is much more intuitive right
                  here. You get the three color wheels and other grading tools
                  it's very lightweight and I didn't find any stability issues
                  however it does have problems playing back 4k footage and I
                  tested this on different computers and it always had the same
                  issues.

                <h2 class="title is-4">3. Davinci Resolve</h2>
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  Davinci resolve probably the best one on the list but also the
                  most popular and I know that a lot of you guys are already
                  working in it now resolve has a couple of workspaces in which
                  you can do different tasks like editing fusion is for via vx
                  color grading and sound mix within every color space you
                  basically, get any tool that a professional video editor needs
                  keyframing goes very smooth there is a pretty big effects
                  library and their color grading tools are of course one of the
                  best on the market however it does all work very differently
                  than premiere. I had lots of trouble because it is node-based
                  it's not worse but it's something that you need to get
                  familiar with.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2 class="title is-4">4. Avid Media Composer</h2>
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  Avid Media Composer it's considered the standard for video
                  editing in film and television although that has been changing
                  a a little bit in the last couple of years Avid is a pretty
                  expensive program but they also have a light version which
                  they call first and that is free now Media Composer is a very
                  stable program it is super responsive even much better than
                  the premiere you have all the tools that you need, but even
                  though it's a feature-packed editing program I had the most
                  frustrations with this one it felt like the inner phrase just
                  didn't make sense. When I was typing and it was creating
                  animations that I didn't asked it to do and when I tried
                  animating a clip I could create keyframes but I wasn't able to
                  change the position until suddenly my clip started to rotate
                  also every action I do requires a thousand clicks simple tasks
                  like deleting, effects, moving clips around in a timeline or
                  simply changing the speed of a clip, all felt so bulky and not
                  user friendly now I'm going to blame me for that as I'm not
                  used to editing with avid but from all the programs that I
                  tested and researched I spent the most time in avid and I
                  still don't get it but maybe you do it's great that it's free
                  so you can try it out without losing any money.
                </p>

                <h2 class="title is-4">5. Hitfilm Express</h2>
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  Hitfilm Express is also a very popular editing program among
                  creators and its interface comes very close to premiere pro in
                  the fact it feels exactly like I'm editing in premiere there
                  was absolutely no learning curve for me creating animations
                  works the same and you even have all the customizations to
                  ease your keyframes or even to fine-tune them in a graph
                  editor and what I love is that there's even a motion blur
                  option by default, we get our familiar toolbar with things
                  like the rage. The stretch tool we can draw masks and animate
                  it over time and there's even a motion tracker something that
                  premiere can't do unless you bring your footage to
                  after-effects so personally I'm the most excited about Hitfilm
                  but that is probably because it just feels so familiar the
                  biggest drawback that I found was playback if you're working
                  with 4k or higher resolutions Hitfilm does have a lot of
                  trouble playing that back while other programs like avid or
                  resolve went butter smooth.

                <h2 class="title is-4">6. Kdenlive</h2>
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  Kdenlive is completely free and open-source which comes again
                  with most of the professional features that we need in an
                  editing program we can animate properties using keyframes
                  there are a bunch of effects not many but the essentials are
                  there we have color grading tools like the color wheels and
                  even scopes such as the waveform vectorscope etc. In Kdenlive
                  we have masking abilities and there's even a motion tracker so
                  we get all the features that we need it do feel a little bit
                  old-fashioned but playback goes pretty smooth it has some
                  trouble loading in the footage but once it sits in the
                  timeline it goes fine so it's a worthy premiere alternative.

                <h2 class="title is-4">7. Filmora Pro</h2>
                <p class="subtitle is-5">
                  Filmora Pro now I am cheating a little bit with the last one
                  as it's not free there is a free version that gives you all of
                  the features but it will leave a watermark when you export if
                  you don't like that you can get the editing program for 150
                  bucks or something very cheap for what you get now the reason
                  that I put it on the list is that it also comes with all of
                  the features that we look for in a professional program and
                  just like hit film it resembles premiere pro a lot we can
                  create keyframes change its graph even enable motion blur for
                  animations we get some intuitive color correction tools with
                  scopes we can create masks and also motion track our shots
                  unfortunately just like hit film. Filmora also suffers from
                  playback issues with higher resolution footage now even though
                  we get a ton of professional features it is not where the
                  premiere is at.
