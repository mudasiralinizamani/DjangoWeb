<h2 class="tile is-4">10. C</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  C is by far the most important programming language on this list and is
  responsible for the existence of many of the tools and languages we use every
  single day. Now is the core of almost all operating systems, microcontrollers,
  embedded systems, and a lot of enterprise level applications see is extremely
  flexible and versatile and allows control over low-level components and
  hardware that is not found in many higher level programming languages,
  especially a lot of the other ones on this list. Now, many experienced
  developers, highly recommend learning C as it teaches you many fundamental
  programming concepts that will carry over to a lot of other programming
  languages, C excels at memory management and fast and efficient execution of
  code. And all of that said, C is extremely difficult to learn. It is not
  necessary for many developers, but it's definitely something
</p>
<br />
<h2 class="tile is-4">9. C sharp</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  C sharp is extremely versatile and can be used to make pretty much anything
  that said it is particularly well suited for building windows based
  applications and games, and is also commonly used to build web applications
  and recently has become more popular in mobile app development. Now I'm sure
  many of you are familiar with the game development engine called unity. Uh,
  this uses C-sharp to design and create games. So like other languages on this
  list, C sharp is maintained by Microsoft is continuing to grow year over year.
  One of the core advantages of C-sharp is how massive its library is providing
  you with higher level functionality compared to language to say like Java or C
  plus plus, although this language is not as popular as some of the other
  languages on this list, C sharp is a great language to learn, and it is still
  demanded heavily in the programming industry.

<h2 class="tile is-4">8. PHP</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Now PHP is a general purpose scripting language that is especially well suited
  to server side web development. So it usually runs on a web server and PHP is
  known as an old dying language and there are many alternatives to it now that
  are typically recommended for new development. That being said, many
  developers still must know and be able to write in PHP. And that is because it
  is used all over the web, mostly in older code basis. Now to give you some
  examples, Facebook, Yahoo and Wikipedia were originally developed in PHP and
  WordPress actually uses a ton of PHP today. So there's a few specific cases
  where you may want to use PHP, but personally I wouldn't recommend anyone
  learn it or even use it unless you have a very good reason to do so.
</p>

<br />
<h2 class="tile is-4">7. Ruby</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Now Ruby is a general purpose programming language pretty similar to Python is
  also dynamically typed object oriented. It is a general purpose scripting
  language, and it can be used for many different applications, but obviously
  its most popular implementation is rails otherwise known as Ruby on rails,
  which is used to design web applications. Now Ruby is considered to be more
  elegant than Python in terms of web development and is used on popular sites
  like Shopify, get hub, Airbnb, Fiverr, and many more. It is fast and to very
  strict standards and those standards make it easier to learn and generally
  makes the code much more clear when you're reading through it. And at number
  eight, we have everybody's favorite programming language,
</p>

<br />
<h2 class="tile is-4">6. TypeScript</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  TypeScript is another new ish programming language that was actually developed
  at Microsoft and happens to be a super set of JavaScript. So this means almost
  everything you know about JavaScript is transferable to TypeScript with a few
  minor exceptions. Now TypeScript is, as it reads a statically typed language
  that actually transpiles into native JavaScript. So all your TypeScript code
  actually gets transpired or compiled, whatever you want to call it into
  JavaScript before it runs. Now, the reason why it exists is actually to make
  developers lives easier by providing interfaces modules, optional, static,
  typing, better code navigation, error detection, and just a ton of other
  things that help with maintainability readability and all those things that
  I've mentioned. Now, TypeScript is used in replacement or conjunction with
  JavaScript to provide a better development experience. So while working at
  Microsoft this summer actually wrote a bunch of code for the Python extension
  in vs code using solely TypeScript. So I highly recommend all JavaScript
  developers checkout TypeScript. It won't take you long to learn and it's
  definitely worth it.

<h2 class="tile is-4">5. C++</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  So C plus plus is the industry standard for AAA games and is used extensively
  to develop 3d applications, operating systems, browsers, compilers, and other
  countless performance dependent applications. Now C plus plus is extremely
  fast and as a somewhat unique ability to interface with the user's hardware,
  giving it much more control on a lower level. So imagine like talking to a
  graphics card now C plus plus is known for being a difficult language to learn
  and write in and is not recommended for beginners. Generally speaking, you
  should have a good reason to use C plus plus when there are often easier and
  faster options to develop with now, it's worth noting that C plus plus is also
  used on the web, but typically you'll see it more in embedded systems and
  performance concerned applications. Like I've mentioned now some examples of C
  plus plus it's used in the Apple iOS it's part of Microsoft windows. It's
  using database software like my SQL and of course almost all your AAA 3d games
  use C plus plus.
</p>

<br />
<h2 class="tile is-4">4. Golang</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Golan is number four on this list and is a fairly new and widely used
  programming language. Goaling emerged as an alternative to C plus plus and
  Java for the app developers at Google and was actually created by two Google
  employees and released in 2012. Now robust system level language, right?
  Typically used on the server side for large scale distributed systems goes
  designed around concurrency and is extremely performance. Heavy goes used
  across millions of Google servers and is the backend of some popular websites
  like Dropbox. Now Golang also has Python like syntax and as performance
  similar to C plus plus now this makes it its main advantage in how quickly you
  can develop with it while still maintaining high performance. Now I personally
  am a huge fan of go and would encourage anyone, especially any of you that
  know Python to look into it because it's a really interesting language and
  something to add to your tool belt.

<h2 class="tile is-4">3. Java</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  So Java is known for being a dying programming language, but it's actually
  still quite widely used and comes into our list at number three. Now Java is
  another general purpose language that is well suited for game and mobile app
  development, enterprise level applications, and also web apps. Now Java is a
  statically typed language. It is compiled and although it may be frustrating
  to write in, it provides many advantages in terms of structure and code
  maintainability that you won't get in say Python and JavaScript. Now some of
  those popular applications that use Java are of course Minecraft, the Adobe
  creative suite and most general Android applications. Now, as I said, Java is
  the core for Android mobile app development and all the languages like Kotlin
  now exists. It is still used very heavily over 3 billion devices, run Java and
  it follows the WRA principle, which is write once run anywhere. So once you've
  compiled your Java code, it can run on any device that runs Java. And to
  summarize all of this Java actually is not that bad of a programming language.
  And I would definitely recommend learning it.
</p>

<br />
<h2 class="tile is-4">2. Python</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Python is a general purpose programming language, meaning it has a much wider
  use case than something like JavaScript that would is heavily used in
  server-side applications, ethical and I guess non ethical hacking data
  science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and
  general scripting tasks. Now Python is known to be easy, to learn, easy to
  read and easy to write. So this makes a great for smaller projects and the
  tasks that I listed above, but its main disadvantage comes from its lack of
  speed. And the fact that it is dynamically typed now just like JavaScript.
  This makes it difficult to maintain in large scale projects. So Python has
  also been used in millions of applications around the world. Some of them are
  Instagram, YouTube, Dropbox. It was actually used by NASA in their integrated
  planning system and was even responsible for the AI and the game civilization
  for so Python is usually capable of accomplishing most programming tasks, but
  oftentimes there are far better choices. They may be less versatile, but they
  will be better at that specific task.

<h2 class="tile is-4">1. JavaScript</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  JavaScript is an extremely popular programming language that is used
  everywhere on the web. Now, although JavaScript can be used as a server side
  programming language with tools like node.js , it is commonly run client side
  within a web browser. Now this enables JavaScript to be one of the most
  versatile languages when it comes to building interactive front end user
  interfaces, any modern website, you visit uses a ton of JavaScript to make the
  website interactive and any dialogue form or animation you see is likely being
  controlled by JavaScript. And now with the popularity of front end frameworks
  like boo JS react and angular, it is not surprising the JavaScript tops this
  list. Now as a final thought, it's worth noting that JavaScript is dynamically
  typed, and although it can be used for many other applications, there are
  typically much better choices.
