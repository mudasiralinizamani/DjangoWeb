<h2 class="tile is-4">7. REST API</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  If you want to do any type of web development learn apis they're so powerful
  and almost every single application you're gonna try to build or use is going
  to require apis either that's going to require you to learn how to use api so
  you can pull data from it and do stuff with it or people want you to build
  apis for them so like hey take my json file and turn it into api so i can use
  it from anywhere or take my database turn it into an api so i can use it from
  cloud anywhere in the world there's tons of functionality and use cases for
  how you can use apis like one example i'll give you real world is like i
  wanted to know how much money are we making every day in our business so what
  we're doing is we're using a selenium scraper to go to this one website log in
  and this website by the way does not have an api so like i want to get a text
  message like hey we made 1500 today or we made 3 dollars today on my phone as
  a business owner i want that now as a developer it's your job to be able to
  get me that information but it's tricky so the solution we came up with is
  let's use selenium to log into the website scrape the website and scrape
  yesterday's sales so let's say yesterday's sale says 2600 scrape it now how do
  we send it as a text message here's what we do we launch it up in the cloud so
  we actually put it in a rest api we build an api for and we put it in the api
  and then on my end all i have to do is actually i got to just do a get request
  and pull it from the cloud and using twilio twilio's api send it to myself as
  a text message okay so there are a bunch of different things happening here
  we're using api to actually put it in the cloud and then we're using a get
  request so we're using the api and then we're using twilio's api to send it as
  a text message on my phone guys that cannot happen without apis good luck
  building something like twilio to send text messages good luck building
  something that actually like gets you that information so that's why when you
  use apis you're leveraging what already exists and you're building on top of
  it okay so learn apis they are a brilliant skill you can leverage the power of
  google search engine if you learn apis you can build a python like base
  detection software with like six lines of code because it's using apis and
  it's using something that already exists you can get the power of instagram
  you know like with few lines of code because you can use their apis so i think
  you should definitely have this in your toolbox as a software developer
  javascript developer or web developer.

<h2 class="title is-4">6. Firebase</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Firebase allows you to do everything aws allows you to do i've built tons of
  things with aws and i've built a bunch of things with firebase so much easier
  to go with firebase firebase is built by google anything you can do in aws
  it's 100 times thousand times easier to do it in firebase definitely don't
  start with aws you're gonna get into a nightmare with aws you have to like
  learn about how does redshift database work oh i also have to go to my
  security groups and like whitelist ip addresses oh what is ec2 what are lambda
  functions oh is my function located in oregon or ohio you have to actually
  know that oh like you're a developer you don't want to like start learning and
  becoming like an i.t person right that's kind of annoying so stay away from
  that unless you absolutely need to learn it if you learn it with firebase once
  you learn all the skills you can then apply to aws easy no problem it's just
  so amazing to be able to have a hybrid between a sql and a nosql database and
  it scales so well it is so lightning fast and you can build the two-way
  functionality of like full crud functionality within minutes and it allows you
  to be in your code if you're coding in react or javascript with just a few
  lines of code it gives you full functionality to be able to add things to your
  firebase delete things from your firebase without having to like write full-on
  crazy mvc style programming creating routes all this crazy stuff it allows you
  to do it so fast you don't even need a back-end like node.js or anything like
  that to be able to interface with your firebase app so i would say learn
  firebase i think it's a highly valuable skill and it's only going up as time
  goes on people are learning at extremely fast rate learn firebase.

<h2 class="title is-4">5. typescript</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Think about like react it allows you to write and react code but in a way
  where it is like more statically typed what that means is you're declaring
  your data types as you go along now it might sound annoying to want to do that
  but what's amazing about it is that your code becomes a lot more robust stable
  way easier to read and you will make much less errors on top of that it's a
  skill a lot of people are looking for in a developer and they're willing to
  pay a much higher amount to work with somebody who understands and knows
  typescript.
</p>
<br />
<h2 class="title is-4">4. Redux</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Redux is something that's hard to kind of grasp and understand right away the
  one i explained when if i hit add to basket or add to cart button at the card
  button like maybe changes to one or it changes to two redux can allow you to
  do that without necessarily even hitting refresh and it can actually manage
  the entire state without ever having to go to another page or doing any type
  of redirect and so that state management is a very important skill to learn as
  a javascript or a react developer but because redux is hard learn it in a
  two-step approach the first step is actually learn something called context
  api and then go and learn redux as step two again none of these skills are
  highly paid on their own you kind of have to know multiple things right if you
  want to be a chef you want to be good at cleaning you want to be good at like
  actually cooking you also want to know about spices you can't just be like oh
  the only thing i do is like put it on the stove like i'm really good at like
  microwaving but any type of ecommerce functionality you want to add as a react
  developer you're going to need to learn redux.
</p>
<br />
<h2 class="title is-4">3. GIT</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  GIT is essentially version control or how i think of it as kind of like a time
  machine if you make mistakes it allows you to rewind in your app that you're
  making and go back so for example if you're adding multiple different
  functionality you can think of it like in a video game where you have save and
  checkpoints you can load from really any checkpoint or any save that you made
  so let's say like you build a login functionality into your app you hit save
  then let's say you build in the functionality in your app to display products
  but then imagine for some reason your login functionality broke and then like
  your entire app broke and you're like what the hell just happened like
  everything was working fine and now one month into the project and everything
  is broke what git allows you to do essentially load and you can actually just
  load back to when you built the login functionality is working perfectly and
  just continue from there i think it's one really important skill there's
  almost nobody doing any kind of coding or real development or a job that
  doesn't really know git like i don't know a single person.

<h2 class="title is-4">2. Node.js</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  A lot of companies are still using node.js and they are still paying for that
  so i think it's a valuable skill to learn. So i think that's one of the skills
  you should have in your toolbox.
</p>
<br />
<h2 class="title is-4">1. React.js</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  React is a javascript library so it's still javascript at the end of the day
  but react allows you to do really amazing things with javascript really really
  fast just think about like you take javascript you give it steroids you get
  react it's basically javascript with super powers why should you use reactor
  who else is using react. react is being used by the top tech companies in the
  world some of those companies include tesla, reddit, whatsapp, facebook,
  instagram, paypal and so many other companies that are using react every
  single day that's what they're actually built on. At the end of the day people
  don't really care about your words that much what they want to look at is what
  is your skill level and how they judge you on that is based on what you've
  built the projects so as a developer just let the portfolio. React has
  something called a virtual dom which essentially means that it allows you to
  really change things on the dom really really really fast okay that's the most
  basic way to think about it if you're on instagram and you type in a comment
  it doesn't actually refresh the entire page what it's doing is it's only
  refreshing that comment that's why it's so fast if you guys go to a bunch of
  apps like instagram facebook you'll notice they don't actually refresh things
  happen in real time when you click stuff or when you post stuff the whole page
  doesn't refresh all of that is happening because of react. react has reusable
  components this is another big thing about why you should actually learn and
  use react what does it mean to have reusable components well in react when you
  develop you're actually building things and breaking them into separate
  components of their own.
