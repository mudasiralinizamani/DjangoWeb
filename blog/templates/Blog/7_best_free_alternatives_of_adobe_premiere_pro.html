<h2 class="tile is-4">1. lightworks</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  lightworks is a super lightweight editing program it starts fast playback and
  editing, in general, goes super smooth and that is because of its slim feature
  set, it is mostly used for simple editing and very basic effects so even
  though that you get a professional toolset for editing it doesn't come with
  many features that could be either a drawback or a positive note for the type
  of work that you do know one thing it does have are some very nice color
  correction and grading tools. Lightworks is completely free however you are
  limited to a certain file format and you cannot export higher than a 720p
  resolution if that is a the problem for you then there is, of course, the pro
  version which doesn't have more features other than the export options and the
  supported file formats.

<h2 class="title is-4">2. Shotcut</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Shotcut is completely free there's no pro version or anything like that, and I
  find it very similar to light works however making animations using keyframes
  is much more intuitive right here. You get the three color wheels and other
  grading tools it's very lightweight and I didn't find any stability issues
  however it does have problems playing back 4k footage and I tested this on
  different computers and it always had the same issues.

<h2 class="title is-4">3. Davinci Resolve</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Davinci resolve probably the best one on the list but also the most popular
  and I know that a lot of you guys are already working in it now resolve has a
  couple of workspaces in which you can do different tasks like editing fusion
  is for via vx color grading and sound mix within every color space you
  basically, get any tool that a professional video editor needs keyframing goes
  very smooth there is a pretty big effects library and their color grading
  tools are of course one of the best on the market however it does all work
  very differently than premiere. I had lots of trouble because it is node-based
  it's not worse but it's something that you need to get familiar with.
</p>
<br />
<h2 class="title is-4">4. Avid Media Composer</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Avid Media Composer it's considered the standard for video editing in film and
  television although that has been changing a a little bit in the last couple
  of years Avid is a pretty expensive program but they also have a light version
  which they call first and that is free now Media Composer is a very stable
  program it is super responsive even much better than the premiere you have all
  the tools that you need, but even though it's a feature-packed editing program
  I had the most frustrations with this one it felt like the inner phrase just
  didn't make sense. When I was typing and it was creating animations that I
  didn't asked it to do and when I tried animating a clip I could create
  keyframes but I wasn't able to change the position until suddenly my clip
  started to rotate also every action I do requires a thousand clicks simple
  tasks like deleting, effects, moving clips around in a timeline or simply
  changing the speed of a clip, all felt so bulky and not user friendly now I'm
  going to blame me for that as I'm not used to editing with avid but from all
  the programs that I tested and researched I spent the most time in avid and I
  still don't get it but maybe you do it's great that it's free so you can try
  it out without losing any money.
</p>
<br />
<h2 class="title is-4">5. Hitfilm Express</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Hitfilm Express is also a very popular editing program among creators and its
  interface comes very close to premiere pro in the fact it feels exactly like
  I'm editing in premiere there was absolutely no learning curve for me creating
  animations works the same and you even have all the customizations to ease
  your keyframes or even to fine-tune them in a graph editor and what I love is
  that there's even a motion blur option by default, we get our familiar toolbar
  with things like the rage. The stretch tool we can draw masks and animate it
  over time and there's even a motion tracker something that premiere can't do
  unless you bring your footage to after-effects so personally I'm the most
  excited about Hitfilm but that is probably because it just feels so familiar
  the biggest drawback that I found was playback if you're working with 4k or
  higher resolutions Hitfilm does have a lot of trouble playing that back while
  other programs like avid or resolve went butter smooth.

<h2 class="title is-4">6. Kdenlive</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Kdenlive is completely free and open-source which comes again with most of the
  professional features that we need in an editing program we can animate
  properties using keyframes there are a bunch of effects not many but the
  essentials are there we have color grading tools like the color wheels and
  even scopes such as the waveform vectorscope etc. In Kdenlive we have masking
  abilities and there's even a motion tracker so we get all the features that we
  need it do feel a little bit old-fashioned but playback goes pretty smooth it
  has some trouble loading in the footage but once it sits in the timeline it
  goes fine so it's a worthy premiere alternative.
</p>
<br />
<h2 class="title is-4">7. Filmora Pro</h2>
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Filmora Pro now I am cheating a little bit with the last one as it's not free
  there is a free version that gives you all of the features but it will leave a
  watermark when you export if you don't like that you can get the editing
  program for 150 bucks or something very cheap for what you get now the reason
  that I put it on the list is that it also comes with all of the features that
  we look for in a professional program and just like hit film it resembles
  premiere pro a lot we can create keyframes change its graph even enable motion
  blur for animations we get some intuitive color correction tools with scopes
  we can create masks and also motion track our shots unfortunately just like
  hit film. Filmora also suffers from playback issues with higher resolution
  footage now even though we get a ton of professional features it is not where
  the premiere is at.
