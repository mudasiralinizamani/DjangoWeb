<h2 class="tile is-4">5. Weebly</h2>
<img src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/weebly.jpg' %}" alt="" />
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  I noticed that the sign up process in weebly is very easy you can register for
  free with just a name email and password and then you immediately get started
  by choosing the type of website that you want to create and viewing a handful
  of themes within that category. Now they really don't have many themes to
  choose from which is a downside but the ones that they do have each have a
  very clean and creative design the user dashboard for your account is very
  minimal and easy to navigate which i really liked and the editing interface
  was as well it's got this really cool simple drag and drop method of building
  your website where you can add text, images, galleries, contact, forms,
  buttons, videos and more to drag an element in you just simply tap and hold on
  it and then place it wherever you want.

<h2 class="title is-4">4. Wix</h2>
<img src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/wix.png' %}" alt="" />
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  wix is very easy to sign up with for free and get started on any type of
  website that you want and any extra added features such as a blog a booking
  page a store and more then they have about 15 different themes that you can
  choose from their editing interface was pretty user friendly because you can
  just click on any section that you want change the text images and buttons the
  downside was that you can't change the font or color of the text within a
  theme you would have to choose a completely different theme in order to do
  this you can add a new section by tapping on the plus button anywhere you want
  to place it but i found that they don't have many options to choose from as
  far as new sections and certain things like adding an instagram section you
  have to actually go over to a physical computer to connect with no instruction
  on how to do that one thing i did like was that you can easily change the
  themes with the button at the bottom as well as add or delete new pages for
  your website i also like that customizing the contact form was pretty robust
  being able to add images a map custom business address and more but another
  downside to wix was that the user dashboard was very busy and confusing it
  actually took me a while to figure out how to get back to editing my website
  once i was in the user dashboard but on the other hand you can see analytics
  handle email marketing create coupons for your store add new roles and
  permissions to other people and more all through the user dashboard on your
  phone.

<h2 class="title is-4">3. MilkShake</h2>
<img src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/milkshake.png' %}" alt="" />
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  After signing up you can immediately grab a free url but you can't get a
  custom.com domain which is unfortunate the user interface is very simple you
  can select a card pick a style or theme for that card and then edit the image
  the text the button text and the url and the descriptions and there's this
  really cool shake it up button where you can instantly see your card in
  different styles after you've created it now there were a few major downsides
  to milkshake though number one is that there's only a few cards to choose from
  none of which are a contact form or anything with advanced functionality to
  add to your website purely visual number two the final website isn't able to
  be scrolled up or down it's navigated left and right hence the cards which
  will end up hiding a lot of your content and number three there is no desktop
  view even viewing the site on a desktop it shows up looking like a mobile
  simulation.

<h2 class="title is-4">2. UNIVERSE</h2>
<img src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/universe.jpg' %}" style="height: 10%" alt="" />
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Universe was actually a very interesting find and it's fairly new after
  opening the app you can choose from a custom domain if you'd like which was
  very expensive because you're paying for universe pro with it so it comes out
  to around 25 dollars a month or 120 a year but you can get a free domain by
  tapping on skip but you won't be able to choose what that domain is then you
  simply pick the type of website that you want browse through their pre-made
  styles and then you can start editing and the editing is very very
  user-friendly you simply tap and hold for a second and drag over the amount of
  blocks that you want to create a new element for and then you can choose an
  element such as text photos videos buttons contact forms galleries and more
  and you can reorder anything you want by simply tapping and holding and then
  dragging any element wherever you want it and you can add new rows at the
  bottom as well as change the background and the theme of your website at any
  time you can also change the font colors and size of the text which is
  fantastic universe made making a website very fun and creative which is why
  it's my second favorite app i love that you can create an awesome mosaic
  effect with elements on your website and customize how the images are
  displayed you can also decide on how each element will function such as
  opening up a new page opening up a new website sending an email or calling a
  phone number the downside was that if you want to view the website on desktop
  it looks more like a tablet version than an actual desktop version so i'd
  consider this website best for someone who wants a digital business card
  that's easily shareable over mobile but all in all the user interface was
  incredible.

<h2 class="title is-4">1. Square Space</h2>
<img src="{% static 'Pics/Blogs/squarespace.jpeg' %}" alt="" />
<p class="subtitle is-5">
  Squarespace was by far my favorite because it was most directly replicated to
  what it's like to build a website on the computer version of squarespace but
  with the comfort and ease of a phone and squarespace i genuinely tested all
  these apps for several days and found that this one was my favorite upon
  opening the app you immediately get started by picking a template and you have
  tons of options and what i loved about squarespace was that you can see what
  your website will look like on desktop tablet and mobile directly on your
  phone it gives you a simulation of each one and the user dashboard was very
  easy to navigate between finding where to edit your website edit your header
  and customizing the overall style of your website and there's a menu at the
  bottom to add or reorganize pages on your site as well as site settings such
  as changing the logo the title handling your email marketing seo admin
  permissions for other editors blogging and more editing my site with
  squarespace was very easy to do you can use the style editor button up at the
  top right to change fonts color schemes animations button styles and more
  across your entire website you can change text by just tapping and typing as
  well as changing button text and adding custom urls to buttons you can add new
  sections anywhere by tapping on the plus button and selecting any custom block
  that you want out of several different categories there's lots of designs and
  layouts to choose from for each block and it's as simple as adding it to your
  site and replacing the text in the images i also found it easy to customize
  your contact form by adding new fields and putting in where you want your
  emails to be sent to and you can even connect cloud storage such as google
  drive or you can even hook up mailchimp to build an email subscriber list and
  all the websites on the squarespace app are fully responsive for mobile tablet
  and desktop so you don't have to do any extra editing.
